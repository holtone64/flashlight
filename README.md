android flashlight that can use Lollipop classes

I don't actually have a Lollipop device, so I have no idea whether that code works or not due to the emulator having trouble 
with the flash feature.  Handler should probably be changed to "null" in any calls that use it.

callback listeners may be constructed too early.  Don't know if it matters.
